### Calculator üßÆ

The Calculator project is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It highlights error handling in JavaScript, demonstrating robust application development.

**Key Techniques:**
- `Try and catch` for error handling to ensure the application can gracefully handle unexpected inputs or mathematical errors.

### Math Learning üìê

This project is an educational tool aimed at facilitating the learning of basic mathematics. It provides users with problems to solve and feedback based on their answers.

**Key Techniques:**
- `Switch case` statements to handle different types of math problems.
- Use of `Math` methods for generating problems and evaluating answers.

### Quiz ‚ùì

A dynamic quiz application that tests users on various topics. It illustrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP), modular design, and data persistence.

**Key Techniques:**
- `OOP` (Object-Oriented Programming) for structuring the application.
- JavaScript `modules` for organizing code.
- `Local storage` for saving user progress and scores.

### Weather Widget ‚òÄÔ∏è

This widget provides real-time weather information based on the user's location, showcasing the use of web APIs and geolocation.

**Key Techniques:**
- `Geolocation` to obtain the user's current location.
- `Fetch API` for retrieving weather data from external services.

### World Clock üåç

Displays the current time in various time zones around the world, utilizing JavaScript's date and time capabilities.

**Key Techniques:**
- Use of the `Date` method to manage and display time information.

### To-Do List üìù

A simple yet powerful to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It demonstrates the use of local storage for data persistence.

**Key Techniques:**
- `Local storage` for storing and retrieving user tasks.


### Challenges and Learnings
üöÄ The integration of JavaScript introduced new challenges, such as ensuring seamless interaction and maintaining performance. I learned valuable lessons in scripting for the web, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and responsive design principles for dynamic content.

### Feedback Request
üì¢ I welcome any feedback on the project, especially regarding:
- The integration and functionality of JavaScript elements
